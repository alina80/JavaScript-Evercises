> Complete the exercises in appropriate files.

**IMPORTANT - do not change the file structure or filenames and use the prepared variables**


Complete the exercises in `app.js` unless the exercise description says otherwise.

#### Exercise 1

1. In `app.js`, write a function named```boilEgg``` that will take time in seconds as a parameter, and calling the function will cause the following message to be displayed in the console after a given time:  
   `egg boiled`
2. Additionally, while boiling, each `5` seconds the following message will be displayed in the console: `egg is boiling`.
3. test your function for `30` seconds (boiling time).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Exercise 2

1. Take a look at `exercise02.js` and test how both functions work.
2. Why does the function named `one` not have the access to the variable named ```variable2```?

To confirm that you have understood the subject, try to write a comment for each line of code.

#### Exercise 3

1. Take a look at `exercise03.js` and test how the ```sortArray``` function works.

To confirm that you have understood the subject, try to write a comment for each line of code.

#### Exercise 4

1. In `app.js`, create a function that will take numbers as parameters and display the greatest of them.  
   Use the ```arguments``` variable.

Example:
```
input -> 5, 29, 6, 4, 34, 56, 2, 3
output -> 56
```
