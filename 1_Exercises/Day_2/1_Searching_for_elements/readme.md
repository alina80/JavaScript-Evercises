#  Searching for elements

> Complete the exercises in appropriate files.

Complete the exercises in `app.js` unless the exercise description says otherwise.
Remember to separate exercises with comments and to write legible, well-formatted code.  

**Do not modify the HTML code unless the instructions say otherwise.**

**IMPORTANT - do not change the file structure or filenames and use the prepared variables**

#### Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

1. Search ```article``` **tag**  with ```first``` **class** on the page and save it in an appropriately named variable.
2. Then:
   * display in the console, how many **h1** elements are in that **tag**.
   * search the tag for all elements with ```offers``` **class**, iterate through them and display them in the console,
   * search the tag for all **div** elements, iterate through them and display them in the console.

Remember to check each time if you have loaded the right elements. Use functions that search for many elements.
Each time, write in the console how many elements you have found.

#### Exercise 2 - done with the lecturer

1. Search the page for the element with `exercise2` **id** that is in the menu, and save it in a variable. Use a CSS selector.

Do not refer to the **class** or **id** of any element directly.
Use descendant, child, n-th child, selectors, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Exercise 3

Search the page for the following elements and save them in appropriately named variables:
1. Element with ```home``` **id** (two ways).
2. The first **li** element that does not have the ```data-direction``` attribute.
3. The first element with ```block``` **class**.

Remember to check each time if you have loaded the right elements. Use functions that search for just one element.


#### Exercise 4

Search the page for the following elements and save them in appropriately named variables:
1. All **li** elements that are in the ```nav``` **tag**.
2. All **paragraphs** belonging to all **div** elements.
3. All **divs** placed in the ```article``` **tag**.

Remember to check each time if you have loaded the right elements. Use functions that search for many elements.
Each time, write in the console how many elements you have found.

#### Additional exercise

1. Find all **li** elements in the ```nav``` tag.
2. Next, give the ```data-direction="top"``` attribute to each **li** element that does not have this attribute set yet.
