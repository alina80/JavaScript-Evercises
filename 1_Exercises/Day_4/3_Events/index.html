          Iron Man is a wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist,
          who fights evil with a set of powered suits of armor of his own design,

          of superheroes called the Avengers.

          Thor was created by editor-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and penciller-plotter
          Jack Kirby. He has starred in several ongoing series and limited series, and is
          a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers, appearing in each volume
          of that series. The character is based on Thor, a god from Norse mythology.
          Thor is one of the founders of the Avengers, a member of the group in all four editions
          of the comic.
