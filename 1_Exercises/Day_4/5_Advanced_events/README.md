#  jQuery - advanced events

Complete the exercises in `app.js` unless the exercise description says otherwise.
Remember to separate exercises with comments, and write legible, well-formatted code.   

**Do not modify the HTML code unless the instructions say otherwise.**

**IMPORTANT - do not change the file structure or filenames and use the prepared variables**

#### Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

1. In the section with `task_1` class n the page, you will find a button. Save it in a variable.  
2. When the button is clicked, create a ```div``` element with ```panel``` **class** and insert it in the section from point 1.  
3. Add any text to it using jQuery and hide that text.
4. Add an event to the `div` element that will show the hidden text when the ```div``` is hovered over.
5. Add several `divs` by clicking the button, and check if the text appears on each of them.
